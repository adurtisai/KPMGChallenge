We need to use the Azure Instance Metadata Service


The Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) provides information about currently running virtual machine instances. You can use it to manage and configure your virtual machines. This information includes the SKU, storage, network configurations, and upcoming maintenance events

IMDS is a REST API that's available at a well-known, non-routable IP address (169.254.169.254). You can only access it from within the VM. Communication between the VM and IMDS never leaves the host. Have your HTTP clients bypass web proxies within the VM when querying IMDS, and treat 169.254.169.254 the same as 168.63.129.16.

Powershell command
